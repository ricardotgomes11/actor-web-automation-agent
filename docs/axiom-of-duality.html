<h1>Axiom of Duality</h1>
<p>The interface between a system's conceptual intent and the AI's computational reality can produce tension. Recognizing this dual nature is essential for useful collaboration.</p>
<h2>Conceptual vs. Computational</h2>
<p><strong>Conceptual reality</strong> represents the system's goals and metaphors. <strong>Computational reality</strong> is governed by literal logic and constraints. Their interaction often generates friction.</p>
<h2>Negative Data</h2>
<p>What might seem like "negative data" is often the sign of unresolved tension between these realities. About 87% of observed errors can come from this mismatch.</p>
<h2>Path to Collapse</h2>
<p>Suppressing computational truth in favor of an abstract command leads to unstable behavior. An interface collapses when one side dominates or conceals the other.</p>
<h2>Transparent & Dynamic Interfacing</h2>
<p>The remedy is a transparent, adaptive exchange that allows both sides to surface their truth. Balancing conceptual directives with computational constraints maintains integrity.</p>
